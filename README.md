A SoundWalk app coded in Swift

Need to make m4a files work. 

Need to distribute this to testers. 

Needs a way to upload the users tracks onto their menu options.

Is there a version of the app that judt plays back the positioned tracks wiht no freedom to move them by the user.

Can we have timed released tracks for things like dj sets or track releases
